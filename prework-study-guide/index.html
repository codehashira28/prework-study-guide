          <li>Semantic elements are HTML elements that clearly describe their meaning to both the browser and other developers.</li>
          <li>We use semanctic HTML elements to organize the content of our page.</li>
          <li>Semantic elements are also good for SEO (search engine optimization) and accessibilty (i.e. screen readers).</li>
          <li>Examples of semantic elements include: &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and &lt;section&gt; because they clearly define their content and purpose.</li>
          <li>Non-semantic element examples are the div and span elements because they tell us nothing about their content.</li>
